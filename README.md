# blood_particle_system
A basic particle system that is coded with processing, a java based graphics library.
It allows user to controll different properties of the particles (shape, number, colour, etc.) with ControlP5 GUI. Some realistic rendering effect like collision detections can be toggled on and off in the GUI provided too.
